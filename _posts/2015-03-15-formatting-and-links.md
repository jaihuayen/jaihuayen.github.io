Advancements in hardware devices and language models are propelling us into the age of artificial intelligence. Consequently, acquiring knowledge in both the theoretical and practical aspects of natural language processing (NLP) is crucial for delving deeper into industry applications. The objective of this course is to offer a comprehensive introduction to machine learning in relation to language models.

## Prerequisites

- Topic 1 & 2: Basic vector calculus and Python programming (PyTorch)
