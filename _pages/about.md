Hi I am Jaihua! You can call me Kevin if you are not used to speak Chinese name.

Currently, I serve as an Senior AI Software Engineer at [QNAP](https://www.qnap.com/en), where my primary focus lies in training computer vision models for tasks like image classification and OCR. My responsibilities extend to deploying these models on edge AI runtimes. Additionally, I contribute to the optimization and deployment of zero-shot language-image models like MCLIP in [QuMagie](https://www.qnap.com/en-us/software/qumagie) and [QSirch](https://www.qnap.com/en-us/software/qsirch).

In my previous role as an AI Algorithm Engineer at [TutorABC](https://www.tutorabc.com/site/en_us), I specialized in data analysis of customer and product data. I applied natural language processing and computer vision techniques to analyze consumer responses, company products, and services. The goal was to enhance user experience and boost company revenue. Furthermore, I played a key role in implementing Docker, Airflow ETL processes, and CI/CD processes to establish MLOps within the AI team.
